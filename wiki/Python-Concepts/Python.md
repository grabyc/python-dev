## Data Types

This section covers user stories related to Python's built-in data types, including their behavior, operations, and integration in Python code.

### Purpose of Data Types User Stories
- Illustrate practical scenarios for using Python's built-in data types
- Demonstrate arithmetic, string, and boolean operations
- Serve as reference implementations for common patterns and behaviors

#### User Stories
- [User Story 110: Python Data Types Basics](/Python-Concepts/User-Story-110-Data-Types-Basics)

---

## Advanced Data Types

This section covers user stories related to Python's advanced data types and collections, such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.

### Purpose of Advanced Data Types User Stories
- Demonstrate list, dictionary, tuple, and set operations
- Show mutability, immutability, and uniqueness properties
- Provide reference implementations for collection behaviors

#### User Stories
- [User Story 111: Python Advanced Data Types](/Python-Concepts/User-Story-111-Advanced-Data-Types)

---

## Type Hints

This section covers user stories related to Python's type hints, static typing, and type checking tools.

### Purpose of Type Hints User Stories
- Demonstrate the use of function and variable type annotations
- Show how static type checkers (like mypy) catch type mismatches
- Provide reference implementations for type-safe Python code

#### User Stories
- [User Story 112: Python Type Hints](/Python-Concepts/User-Story-112-Type-Hints)

---

## Type Conversion

This section covers user stories related to Python's type conversion (type coercion), both implicit and explicit, and error handling for invalid conversions.

### Purpose of Type Conversion User Stories
- Demonstrate implicit type coercion (e.g., int + float â†’ float)
- Show explicit type conversion (e.g., str to int)
- Provide examples of error handling for invalid conversions

#### User Stories
- [User Story 124: Python Type Conversion](/Python-Concepts/User-Story-124-Type-Conversion)

---

## Mutability

This section covers user stories related to mutability and immutability in Python, including the behavior of lists, tuples, and shared references.

### Purpose of Mutability User Stories
- Demonstrate how mutable and immutable types behave in Python
- Show the effects of modifying lists and tuples
- Illustrate shared reference side effects with mutable objects

#### User Stories
- [User Story 125: Python Mutability](/Python-Concepts/User-Story-125-Mutability)
