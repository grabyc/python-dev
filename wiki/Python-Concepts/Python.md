## Data Types

This section covers user stories related to Python's built-in data types, including their behavior, operations, and integration in Python code.

### Purpose of Data Types User Stories
- Illustrate practical scenarios for using Python's built-in data types
- Demonstrate arithmetic, string, and boolean operations
- Serve as reference implementations for common patterns and behaviors

#### User Stories
- [User Story 110: Python Data Types Basics](/Python-Concepts/User-Story-110-Data-Types-Basics)

---

## Advanced Data Types

This section covers user stories related to Python's advanced data types and collections, such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.

### Purpose of Advanced Data Types User Stories
- Demonstrate list, dictionary, tuple, and set operations
- Show mutability, immutability, and uniqueness properties
- Provide reference implementations for collection behaviors

#### User Stories
- [User Story 111: Python Advanced Data Types](/Python-Concepts/User-Story-111-Advanced-Data-Types)

---

## Type Hints

This section covers user stories related to Python's type hints, static typing, and type checking tools.

### Purpose of Type Hints User Stories
- Demonstrate the use of function and variable type annotations
- Show how static type checkers (like mypy) catch type mismatches
- Provide reference implementations for type-safe Python code

#### User Stories
- [User Story 112: Python Type Hints](/Python-Concepts/User-Story-112-Type-Hints)
