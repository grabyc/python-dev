# User Story 128: Python Conditional Logic

## Overview
This user story demonstrates the use of conditional statements in Python, including `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks. Conditional logic allows programs to make decisions and execute code based on specific conditions.

## Purpose
- Show how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control program flow
- Illustrate practical examples of conditional logic
- Serve as a reference for writing decision-making code in Python

## Example
```python
x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is negative")
```

## Key Points
- The `if` statement checks a condition and executes its block if true.
- The `elif` (else if) statement checks additional conditions if previous ones are false.
- The `else` statement executes if none of the previous conditions are true.
